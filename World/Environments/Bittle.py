class Bittle:
    """
    A general-purpose environment:

    Must accept: **kwargs as init arg.

    Must have:

    (1) a "step" function, action -> exp
    (2) "reset" function, -> exp
    (3) "render" function, -> image
    (4) "episode_done" attribute
    (5) "obs_spec" attribute which includes:
        - "shape", "mean", "stddev", "low", "high" (the last 4 can be None)
    (6) "action-spec" attribute which includes:
        - "shape", "discrete_bins" (should be None if not discrete), "low", "high", and "discrete"
    (7) "exp" attribute containing the latest exp

    Recommended: Discrete environments should have a conversion strategy for adapting continuous actions (e.g. argmax)

    An "exp" (experience) is an Args consisting of "obs", "action" (prior to adapting), "reward", and "label"
    as numpy arrays with batch dim or None. "reward" is an exception: should be numpy array, can be empty/scalar/batch.

    ---

    Can optionally include a frame_stack, action_repeat method.
