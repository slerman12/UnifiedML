Python has something called [magic methods](https://rszalski.github.io/magicmethods/). One of these is the ```__init__``` method, which initalializes a class. See below:

```python
class AGI:
    """A General Intelligence"""

    def __init__(self):
        ...


print(f'{AGI.__init__} is a method for initializing class "AGI".')
```

```AGI.__init__``` can also be spelled ```AGI.init``` or pronounced Agent.

The magic function of our organization is to initiate AGI.

# By principle, our code is written to be:
1. Beautiful
2. Elegant minimalism
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- no over-the-top abstractification for the sake of minimalism
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- less is more, sharp
3. Flexible
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- our code should feel alive, like we could use it in a module "plug-and-play"
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- adaptive, inferring and broadcasting when possible
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Pleasing to write new code with 
4. Clear
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- it should be as useful pedagogically as practically
5. Powerful
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- it should not sacrifice performance
6. "Essential"
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- boiling ideas down to their core first-principle essences.
7. Poetic
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- it should read like poetry. Variables and classes should be intuitive and well-structured at first glance.


# These are our standards
* the environment
* justice among all peoples
* anti-militarism
* anti-surveillance
* anti-greed
* kindness and love
* communication and understanding
* universal agriculture (automated), automated robot-assisted distribution of goods, and self-sustaining energy production
* construction/irrigation
* social intimacy and connection
* wildlife
* preservation of mother earth and humanity's relationship with it

<!-- *__AI is not about__ reproducing the effects of human intelligence in video games like Atari or simulated locomotive tasks like Humanoid. AI isn't even about making robots do those things in the real world. AI is about intelligence, artificially manifest via engineering yet no less profound than the biological variety, no less rooted in the natural principles of evolution, time, and incremental progress. Artificial Intelligence is therefore a misnomer, for it is no more artificial than a planned birth or a garden vs. wild meadows. AI is the plot of land that we till and sow with our engineering minds, yet the fruit of its germination will help nourish and enfree mankind like that which nature procured herself, and deepen our understanding of life in the process. As Richard Feynman put it: to truly understand something, you must be able to build it yourself.*

## Principles

> "If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough"
>
> -*Albert Einstein*

In our code, we strive for:

- *Minimalism*
- *Beauty*
- *Pedagogical clarity*
- *SOTA performance*

All 4.

On a broader level:

- *Humanity before mechanization*
- *Heart before calloused mind*
- *The earth and sky, mountains and brooks, fauna and flora, before industrialization*

Politically:

- *Environmentalism*
- *Democratization*
- *Equity*

And going a step further:

- *Anti-militarism*
- *Anti-surveillance*

The latter two are less frequently cited by other, leading institutions.

## Our Pledge

We will always put humanity, nature, and Mother Earth first, ahead in the queue before money, bottom line, propriety, or even the art itself.

We will make technology that frees humankind to pursue the passions and callings of the spirit, not further enslave it beneath illusory mists of technological luxury, leaving no footprint of harm on the mental, physical, or spiritual spheres of biological existence.
